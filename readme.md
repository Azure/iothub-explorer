  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

Each **iothub-explorer** command has its own help that can be viewed by passing `help` the command name:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer help create

  Usage: iothub-explorer create [options] [device-id|device-json]
  
  Create a device identity in your IoT hub device registry, either using the specified device id or JSON description.

  Options:

    -h, --help                       output usage information
    -a, --auto                       create a device with an auto-generated device id
    -cs, --connection-string         show the connection string for the newly created device
    -d, --display <property-filter>  comma-separated list of device properties that should be displayed
    -l, --login <connection-string>  connection string to use to authenticate with your IoT Hub instance
    -k1, --key1 <key>                specify the primary key for newly created device
    -k2, --key2 <key>                specify the secondary key for newly created device
    -r, --raw                        use this flag to return raw JSON instead of pretty-printed output
    -x, --x509                       generate an x509 certificate to authenticate the device
    -dv, --daysValid                 number of days the x509 certificate should be valid for
    -t1, --thumbprint1 <thumbprint>  specify the primary thumbprint of the x509 certificate
    -t2, --thumbprint2 <thumbprint>  specify the secondary thumbprint of the x509 certificate
```

## Examples

### Working with the device identity registry

Supply your IoT hub connection string once using the **login** command. This means you do not need to supply the connection string for subsequent commands for the duration of the session (defaults to one hour):

```shell
$ iothub-explorer login "HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=<my-policy>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>"

Session started, expires Fri Jan 15 2016 17:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

> Note: See [Set up IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/setup_iothub.md) for information about how to retrieve your IoT hub connection string.

To retrieve information about an already-registered device from the device identity registry in your IoT hub, including the device connection string, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer get known-device --connection-string

-
  deviceId:                   known-device
  ...
-
  connectionString: HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=known-device;SharedAccessKey=<known-device-key>
```

To register a new device and get its connection string from the device identity registry in your IoT hub, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer create new-device --connection-string

Created device new-device

-
  deviceId:                   new-device
  ...
-
  connectionString: HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=new-device;SharedAccessKey=<new-device-key>
```

To delete a device from the device identity registry in your IoT hub, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer delete existing-device
```

<a name="devices"/>

### Working with devices

Use the following command to monitor the device-to-cloud messages from a device:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer monitor-events myFirstDevice --login "HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=<my-policy>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>"

Monitoring events from device myFirstDevice
Listening on endpoint iothub-ehub-<my-endpoint>/ConsumerGroups/$Default/Partitions/0 start time: 1453821103646
Listening on endpoint iothub-ehub-<my-endpoint>/ConsumerGroups/$Default/Partitions/1 start time: 1453821103646
Event received: 
{ deviceId: 'myFirstDevice', windSpeed: 10.92403794825077 }

Event received: 
{ deviceId: 'myFirstDevice', windSpeed: 10.671534826979041 }

Event received: 
{ deviceId: 'myFirstDevice', windSpeed: 13.557703581638634 }

Event received: 
{ deviceId: 'myFirstDevice', windSpeed: 11.123057782649994 }
```

> Note: The **monitor-events** command requires you to provide the IoT Hub connection string even if you have created a session using the **login** command.

Use the following commands to send a cloud-to-device command and then wait for the device to respond with an acknowledgment:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer send myFirstDevice MyMessage --ack=full

Message sent (id: 13bc1852-eeb4-4611-b0bd-329d80c83f6f)

$ iothub-explorer monitor-feedback myFirstDevice

Waiting for feedback... (Ctrl-C to quit)
